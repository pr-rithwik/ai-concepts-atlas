# The AI Core Concepts Atlas

### Introduction
Navigating the world of Artificial Intelligence requires a clear map. This repository serves as a **Conceptual Atlas** to the modern AI landscape, designed as a quick-reference visual guide.

This atlas prioritizes clarity and the **connections between ideas**. Each map is an interactive artifact that consolidates the key components of a major domain within AI, providing a high-level understanding of how everything fits together.
